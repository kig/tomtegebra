- story mode to tie up the action, run around the game world on a top-down map
    - dependencies determine where you can go
      e.g. if frog uses cat, you need to get cat before you can take frog on
    - find lemmas, extra moves and time stoppers to make hard levels easier

- time attack / limited move count
    - levels with time limit (e.g. normal cat 1 min / equation, black cat 30 s / eq)
    - or move limit (e.g. hard cat 5 substitutions / eq)

- polymorphic lemmas, bound to some property of op (assoc, neutral, inverse, commutative)
  e.g. if o is assoc, neutral and inverse then: (A o B) o inv(op, B) = A, because
                                                A o (B o inv(op, B)) = A o neutral(o) = A
       if o is also commutative then: (B o A) o inv(op, B) = A

- show Assoc Neutral Inverse Commutative with four jewels around op
     A
   N o I
     C

- treasure chests with helpful lemmas / helper items / money
    = bonus level where you try to prove an equation to get it in your inventory
- shop
- lemma builder
